# F.A.Q.

Who is this book for ?
: Programmers familiar with C.

What will I learn ?
: To push the limit of what you think is possible in C further

Should I push the limit of what I think is possible in C further ?
: You should probably use Zig or Rust instead.
: However there are situations where the stability and ubiquity of C is desired,
  while repeating one-self is not.

Aren't macros dangerous ?
